1. Added meaningful error messages
2. Simplified nested validation logic
3. Late declaration of variables, switched approach to iterating over ordered_ids
4. Removed need for ordered_ids
5. Extracted functions for tree processing
6. Starting to push behaviour into Node class
7. Starting to push behaviour into Record class
8. Clearer naming of loop variables
9. Replaced loop with list comprehension for find_parent logic
10. Implemented object equality for Record instances to hide implementation
11. WIP Greater comprehension of processing (il)logic lead to simplification
12. WIP replacing explicit looping with list comprehensions
13. Replaced explicit list#append with list comprehension
14. More method extraction - not sure why map() isn't working where explicit loops do though
