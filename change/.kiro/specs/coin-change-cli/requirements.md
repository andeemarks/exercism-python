# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Python CLI function that calculates the optimal coin change for a given target amount using specified coin denominations. The function will take a list of valid coin denominations and a target change amount, then return the minimum number of coins needed to make that change.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a CLI function that calculates coin change, so that I can determine the minimum number of coins needed for any given amount.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function is called with valid coin denominations and a target amount THEN the system SHALL return a list of coins that sum to the target amount
2. WHEN multiple coin combinations are possible THEN the system SHALL return the combination that uses the minimum number of coins
3. WHEN the target amount is 0 THEN the system SHALL return an empty list
4. WHEN the target amount cannot be made with the given denominations THEN the system SHALL raise an appropriate exception

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the function to be well-tested, so that I can trust its correctness in various scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function is tested THEN the system SHALL pass all unit tests for valid inputs
2. WHEN the function is tested THEN the system SHALL pass all unit tests for edge cases
3. WHEN the function is tested THEN the system SHALL pass all unit tests for error conditions
4. WHEN performance is tested THEN the system SHALL handle reasonable input sizes efficiently
